Hello!

For this project I wanted to replicate the process many movie theater websites have for ordering movie tickets. 
The project uses OOP and File input/output to collect ticket orders for various movie/times/theaters 
Uses theater class to store unique qualities of each theater like time/type of movie/and ID number
Maintains information on seat availability for each theater by updating a separate seat info file dedicated for each theater
Creates effective User Interface where users can choose seating based on a map of the seating chart
Prints out receipt using order information

Thanks for checking out my code!
